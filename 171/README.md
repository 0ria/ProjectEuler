# Project Euler #171: Finding numbers for which the sum of the squares of the digits is a square

## Working but not optimal, for big numbers it slows too much

For a positive integer n, let f(n) be the sum of the squares of the digits (in base 10) of n, e.g.
f(3) = 3^2 = 9,
f(25) = 2^2 + 5^2 = 29
f(442) = 4^2 + 4^2 + 2^2 = 36
Find the sum of all n, 0 <= n <= k, such that f(n) is a perfect square modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains the only integer k.

## Output 

the only integer which is the answer for the problem.

## Constraints

0 <= k <= 10^100
